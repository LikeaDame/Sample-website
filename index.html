  <h2> Quotations</h2>

  <p> In addition to hosting most of the world's supply of kitten videos, the
    Web is also full of inspiring quotes, perhaps none more so than this one:

  <blockquote style="padding: 2px 20px; background: #1989;">
   <p>
     <em>Don't believe every quote you read on the internet.</em><br>
     -Abraham Lincoln
